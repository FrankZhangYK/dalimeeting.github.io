- title: "Searching for the Principles of Reasoning and Intelligence"

    institute: Deep Mind 
  abstract: "We are collectively dedicated to a common task: a search for the general principles that make possible machines that learn. This leads to the question: What are the universal principles, if there are any, of reasoning and intelligence in machines? My search begins with four statistical operations that expose the dual tasks of learning, and of testing. We can instantiate many different types of inferential questions, and I share some of the paths I've followed in attempting to find general-purpose approaches to them. One such area is variational inference, and I'll briefly discuss the roles of amortised inference, stochastic optimisation, and general-purpose density estimators. For the most part, I'll explore recent work in testing as an inferential principle in implicit probabilistic models, and discuss work in estimation-by-comparison, density ratio estimation, and the method-of-moments. Different types of models require different types of inference, and any general-purpose inferential method remains elusive. I'll unpack some of the current research questions, but there is much more to do; my search for the probabilistic principles of reasoning and intelligence continues."
