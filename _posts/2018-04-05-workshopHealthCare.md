title:  "Healthcare AI: Key to better patient-practitioner-system partnerships"
layout: multitrack
abstract: "Machine learning in healthcare has focused on surfacing useful structure from high-volume, 
sometimes high-velocity, data from technologies such as imaging and 'omics. As this structure is translated 
into actionable information the biomedical ambitions for machine learning are growing. The crossover between 
diagnosis and therapy, in cancer radiotherapy for example, is linking observation and intervention processes 
for more precise care. In closely coupled observation-intervention scenarios, such as brain stimulation linked 
to exoskeleton-guided stroke rehabilitation, AI may open new, multi-component therapies. Single diseases, disciplines, 
mechanisms and healthcare technologies attract narrowly-defined data, learning and inference. Yet, the major burden
of ill-health and healthcare uncertainty lies between these foci, in the noisy, real-world complexity of health and care. 
Some AI investments have started to tackle inference problems such as hastening interventions to save kidney function 
via inferences from sparse clinical data on patients with a wide variety of conditions. Indeed, conditions such as 
high blood pressure and diabetes interact, worsening decline in kidney function. These two conditions and 
drug x may also interact, but in ways not studied in trials of drug x where patients with multiple conditions were excluded. 
In the rhythms of everyday life, key determinants of drug outcomes rest with the patient, for example diet and physical 
activity alongside diabetes medication. Arguably the greatest challenge for AI in healthcare is to surface the dynamics 
of health systems, hastening and targeting interventions. This workshop will assemble a variety of perspectives in accelerating, 
assisting and augmenting patients, practitioners and health system managers with machine learning. We will challenge ourselves to ask: 
Are we asking the right questions for maximum societal impact from health-related machine learning? Are we borrowing strength 
sufficiently across silos of inference? How does this community organise at global scale to share well-formed problems to advance 
methodology and avoid AI hype. </br> </br>"

Fitting more complex functions to a previously published objective is not a good use of machine learning effort; problems need better selection, framing and evaluation metrics."
